# PokeAPI
Learning to use asynchronous coding with Java and PokeAPI

This project significantly enhanced my understanding of using callbacks in conjunction with fetching data from an API. Where I learned to code primarily with Python and C—languages that often emphasize sequential execution—this experience introduced me to the paradigm of asynchronous programming.

Asynchronous programming enables my programs to handle multiple tasks concurrently, improving efficiency and responsiveness, especially in scenarios involving I/O operations or network requests. Learning about callbacks, promises, and async/await mechanisms provided me with practical tools to manage asynchronous workflows effectively. This paradigm shift not only expanded my technical skills but also deepened my appreciation for designing robust and efficient systems capable of handling real-world scenarios.
